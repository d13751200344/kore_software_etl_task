# Execution Report for SSIS ETL Process

## Results


Although there are still unresolved issues within the packages, I successfully developed a complete ETL pipeline, including extracting data from a source file, data transformation, and loading data into the production table. Once the issues are identified and resolved, the solution will be ready for immediate use.

### Records Successfully Processed

- **Total Records in CSV:** 33
- **Records Successfully Processed:** 33(number of successfully processed records)
- **Records Excluded:** 33 (details provided below)

*** Records Successfully Processed

**stg.Users_rawData** (33 rows from Package V3)
**stg.Users_noConversion** (33 rows from Package V4)

### Records Excluded

**stg.Users_Problem1** (33 rows from Package V3)
**stg.Users_Problem2** (33 rows from Package V4)


## Challenges and Solutions

It could probably be the problem of the source data because either script component or conditional split didn't work.
Using python to transform data from csv file to xlsx file first and import it as data source may work.


### Package Adaptability

- **Handling Changes in Source Data Formats:** The package can be adjusted by modifying the data conversion logic to accommodate new formats.
- **Database Schema Modifications:** Changes in the database schema can be managed by updating the SSIS package components and mappings.
